# Event Finder Website

## Overview
This is a single-page, responsive website built to display events with a modern, visually appealing UI. It includes a navigation bar, a hero section, a featured events section with event cards, a search bar to filter events by name, and a contact section.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design using CSS Grid.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Dynamic event loading, search functionality, and mobile menu toggle.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for modern typography.
- **No external dependencies**: All styling and functionality are implemented without frameworks.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://sadiazaffar.github.io/WEBSITE/).
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. No additional setup is required as the only external resource is Google Fonts, loaded via CDN.

## Extra Features
- **Search Bar**: Filters events dynamically by name as the user types.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid for event cards and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu for navigation on smaller screens.
- **Enhanced Styling**:
  - **Typography**: Poppins font for a clean, modern look.
  - **Colors**: Cohesive palette with gradients in navigation, hero, and buttons.
  - **Animations**: Fade-in for hero text, hover effects on navigation links, logo, and event cards (lift and shadow).
  - **Visual Polish**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and a gradient hero background.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Refined spacing and typography for better readability on smaller screens.
